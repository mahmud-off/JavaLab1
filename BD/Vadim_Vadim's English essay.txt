In time, the serious changes become in our world and the most one of them is that, today, people do not feel difference in foreign cultures. The main reason for this is our globalization epoque and that too important is easy access to any information due to Internet.
First of all, there has to be emphasized that, in the modern world, we can exchange goods and services with all planet. Globalization provides us this ability. I agree, that this solve a lot of issues such as low count of food in many countries or exchange of experiences, however, at the same time, we should comprehend that globalization removes borders among cultures. For instance, today, pizza does not associate with Italy it is just a delicious dish that can be cooked worldwide. That is how it works: somebody had brought some things in his country from overseas, after that, the locals liked it and, with years, the parent country of these loss the uniqueness within culture attributes. For this reason, globalization makes people erase culture boundaries.
The second cause that we need to take into account is that Internet ensures easy access to all information. This brings in our world a lot of things such as cultural shifts and mixes. For example, in our digitalization epoque, we have many articles that teach us how make an origami, but we do not thing about the parent country of this piece. Moreover, the author can be an American or a Russian, getting his thinks as foundation. As a result, we get information at the moment, no thinking about the motherland of this.
In conclusion, it can be said that the problem of culture mixing caused by the globalization that makes people remove borders and easy access to information on the Internet, that cutes nodes between things and their motherland.
